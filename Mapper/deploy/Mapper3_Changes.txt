Mapper3 2.2.5
February 12, 2009
-------------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:
 -- Updated the ScanStudio library (revision 2).


Mapper3 2.2.4
January 23, 2008
----------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when a camera mode update was 
    received from the robot server.
 -- Corrected an error that caused Mapper3 to hang when 
    the Map Insert... feature was used but no points were 
    selected for insertion.
 -- Updated the ScanStudio library (revision 51).
 -- Improved the detection and reporting of errors during the 
    processing of Aria maps.  If an erroneous file line is 
    encountered, the user is warned that saving the map file 
    may have unintended consequences.  A new Details section 
    in the warning displays all file lines that were not 
    successfully processed.
 -- Fixed an error in the Main Menu, Map, Map Data menu.  
    When the map contains data for multiple scan types, the 
    initial state of the scan type checkboxes is now correct.
 -- Improved the display and interaction of selected map items.  
    Selected poses are now always drawn on top with an opaque 
    background.  When the mouse enters a selected item, the 
    item gains focus (i.e. it will be picked if the mouse is 
    pressed).  This should make it easier to interact with 
    multiple overlapping items.


Mapper3 2.2.2-1
October 23, 2008
-------------------------

Important Changes:
 -- Now supports multiple laser scan devices in
    .2d scan log files and in map files (does not affect most users).
 -- When Mapper3 is used to edit the current map on the 
    robot or central server, then it may send incremental 
    changes to the server instead of sending the entire map file.  
    These changes will be sent when the Save button is clicked.  
    If they are successfully processed by the server, then 
    Mapper3's watch cursor will revert to normal and the 
    "Sending File" progress window will not be displayed.

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Corrected a bug that occurred when a map file is saved 
    as an image (e.g. JPEG file).  The goal names are no 
    longer written in a ridiculously large font.
 -- Improved the performance of downloading files from the 
    central server.  
 -- Corrected an error that caused duplicate file names to 
    appear when selecting a map file on the robot server.
 -- Fixed crash that occurred when a robot disconnected
    from the central server.
 -- Warn the user if an attempt is made
    to open a specific robot's current map, but that map is really
    being controlled by a central server.
 -- Fixed an error in the Main Menu, Map, Map Data menu.  When 
    the map contains data for multiple scan types, the initial 
    state of the scan type checkboxes is now correct.
 -- Corrected the "Find on Map" item in the goal list 
    context menu so that the goal is selected in the map.
 -- Improved the display and interaction of selected 
    map items.  Selected poses are now always drawn on
    top with an opaque background.  When the mouse enters
    a selected item, the item gains focus (i.e. it will 
    be picked if the mouse is pressed).  This should make it
    easier to interact with multiple overlapping items, 
    especially when used in conjunction with "Find on Map".
 -- Fixed crash in importing .2d files.
 -- Corrected an intermittent error in the location of goals when 
    importing .2d files.
 -- Removed an erroneous extra space from the output Cairn lines 
    for map objects that do not have the "from-to" attributes.
 -- Fixed problems reading a map file that had objects at
    non-integral poses.
 -- Changes were made to ArPose to ensure that the heading
    is in the range -180 to 180.
 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when a map file is inserted
    into another.  If the map legend was previously displayed
    and the two map files contained different data types, 
    then MobilePlanner crashed.
 -- Fixed the Select File dialog so that it does not enter
    an infinite error message loop when the user selects
    a drive that is not accessible.
 -- Fixed potential memory issues.
 -- Added support for the Windows XP style.
 -- Do not open invalid scan (.2d) files.  Valid scan files
    start with LaserOdometryLog.
 -- Warn the user when a scan file contains GPS data.  These
    files cannot be processed correctly by MobilePlanner yet.
 -- Added support for a new "raw" mode in the scan processing.
    This mode may be turned on by clicking the Scan Tools, 
    Settings button, selecting the Scan tab, and changing the
    Processing Mode item to Raw.
 -- Fixed the File, Map Insert... feature when a map contains
    only one type of scan data.
 -- Fixed the Map, Origin menu item so that the origin is
    correctly drawn when multiple map files are open.
 -- Attempted to fix an intermittent bug that prevents the 
    map's points and lines from being displayed.
 -- When a map is being inserted, draw the containing map's
    origin on top of the insert region instead of below it.
 -- Added a Duplicate option to the context menu displayed 
    when right-clicking on items in the map.  The newly 
    created item will appear in the center of the map view.
 -- Corrected a crash that occurred when the user tried to
    save a remote file after the connection to the robot
    was lost.
 -- Fixed an intermittent crash that occurred when the 
    robot connection was lost while the remote file was
    being saved.
 -- Fixed a crash that occurred during File, Insert Map... 
    when the inserted map defined new data types.
 -- Added meta information to the map file about the scan
    that was used to create the map and how long it took to
    process it.
 -- Added a "tear-off" menu item to the Main Menu, Map, Data
    submenu.  This appears as a dashed line at the top of the 
    Data submenu.  When it is selected, the data items appear
    in a standalone window so that they can be toggled easily.


Mapper3 2.1.9
August 3, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- The map file can no longer contain any comments (e.g. text 
    that follows the "#" or ";" characters).  These characters 
    may now be used in the map info definitions.
 -- Corrected an error that caused the "%" character to be  
    followed by a random number when written to a map file.
 -- When a robot file list has been sorted, the selected sort 
    column and direction is used the next time that the file
    list is displayed.
 -- Corrected another potential crash when a robot disconnects.
 -- Added more information (specifically, the robot ID) to the 
    output log.
    

Mapper3 2.1.8
July 25, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 -- Fixed an intermittent crash that occurred when a robot 
    disconnects from Mapper3.

Mapper3 2.1.7
July 19, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Fixed a memory leak that occurred when closing a map file.
 -- Fixed an intermittent crash that occurred when a remote file
    is opened and a robot disconnects from Mapper3.
 -- Corrected an error that occasionally caused Mapper3
    to hang when a scan (.2d) file was opened.
 -- Fixed the "File, Insert Map..." feature so that the inserted 
    map is no longer cached after the insertion is finished.  
 -- Improved the performance of closing very large map files.
 -- When map windows have been tiled or cascaded and another map
    is subsequently opened, the new map is no longer maximized 
    in the workspace.
 -- Improved the user interaction with map items that have been
    tagged as "data" in the MapInfo.  The "data" types no longer
    appear as an option in the Type combo box for normal map 
    items. Similar to map lines, the "data" items are no longer 
    selected by the marquis rectangle; it is necessary to hold 
    down the Ctrl key when selecting multiple "data" items. 


Mapper3 2.1.6
May 30, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Corrected an error in the Scan Settings window.  When the user
    manually types a number into one of the spin box editors, the
    prompt to restart the scan is now correctly displayed.  
 -- Added notification that the Clean Grid Size parameter is now 
    also used in the initial scanning process.  When the parameter
    has been changed, the prompt to restart the scan is also 
    displayed.
 -- Fixed an error in the File Download/Upload window.  When 
    the window is displayed, the directory contents are now 
    correctly refreshed.


Mapper3 2.1.5
May 5, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 -- Corrected an error in the Edit Map Item window that occurred
    when subtypes are defined for multiple MapInfo types.  The 
    selected subtype previously changed on occasion when the user
    clicked the OK button.
  

Mapper3 2.1.4
April 28, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:
  
 -- Corrected an error in the order of destructors that caused an
    intermittent crash when a robot disconnected.


Mapper3 2.1.3
April 27, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Fixed errors related to subdirectory selection in the Open File 
    on Robot dialog.
 -- Fixed various memory leaks that occurred when a robot disconnected.

 
Mapper3 2.1.2
April 4, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Modified the MapInfo definitions so that the IsData attribute 
    applies to all data types.  Maps can now be configured so that
    goals and other locations can be inserted into another map.
 -- Added the MapInfo NameRequired attribute to location types.  The
    default value is true, but it can be overridden if the locations
    do not require a name.
 -- Fixed the toolips on locations in the map view so that if the
    location does not have a name but does have a description, the 
    tooltip is still displayed.
 -- Fixed a bug in File, Insert Map... so that the most recent
    folder is now correctly displayed in the File Open window.
    

Mapper3 2.1.1
March 28, 2007
-------------------  

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Modified the Download/Upload window to include a "Select All" and
    a "Clear All" button for each directory list.
 -- Fixed a bug that occurred when sorting a directory list while files
    were selected.  The original selection is now maintained.
 -- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused the crash dump file to be 
    written to an incorrect directory.
 -- Added an option to save scan (.2d) files as a "corrected scan file"
    (.c2d).
 -- Removed an unused scan parameter, max scan distance.


Mapper3 2.1.0
February 23, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Made substantial changes related to multi-threading in an attempt
    to reduce the number of crashes on dual processor PCs.


Mapper3 2.0.1
January 30, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when a remote file was opened and the
    robot disconnected.  If the user subsequently selected File, 
    Open on Robot and then clicked the Cancel button on the login
    window, then Mapper3 would crash.
 -- Incorporated the latest version of ScanStudio.



Mapper3 1.4.4
January 10, 2007
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Fixed a bug in the Advanced Areas Edit window that occurred when 
    sector types were defined in the map file after any that are 
    "always hidden".  The Type combo box did not display the correct 
    type.
 -- Added a new "Step" button to the Scan Tools.  Click this button 
    to pause the processing and add a single scan.  The current scan 
    number is now displayed in the status bar.  These features are 
    both applicable only while scans are being added (i.e. before 
    registration and cleaning).
 -- Added a new Scan Tools, Settings, Processing preference that 
    allows multiple scan files to be processed in "batch mode".  When 
    running in batch mode, each scan file is automatically saved as a 
    map file and closed; processing of the next file occurs without 
    operator intervention (as long as no errors occur).
 -- Modified the Open File dialog so that multiple map or scan files
    can be opened at once.
 -- Increased the maximum length of a map line to 10,000 characters.


Mapper3 1.4.3
December 21, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:
 
 -- Fixed a memory leak that occurred when saving the map.
 -- When the user creates an unusually small forbidden area or other 
    map object, a warning is now displayed.


Mapper3 1.4.2
December 6, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when opening a map file on a robot
    server (introduced in 1.4.1).
 -- Fixed the File, Open window so that the most recently used 
    directory path is displayed.  
 -- Corrected the File, Download/Upload window so that the Look In: 
    menu on the local computer works correctly with multiple drives.
 -- Improved the display of overlapping goal names in the map.  When 
    the goal has mouse focus, the name is drawn with an opaque 
    background.


Mapper3 1.4.1
December 1, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements:

 -- Added a description attribute to all map objects.  The description
    can be entered in the map item edit window, and it is displayed in
    the map object's tooltip. (For Aria users, note that the unused
    ArMapObject fileName attribute has been deprecated.)
 -- Added a new Advanced Points shape type, Label, that allows the user 
    to mark the map with descriptive text labels.  In order to use this 
    feature, the map file's MapInfo must be updated.
 -- Added new MapInfo parameters to allow specification of the desired 
    font size of a goal or dock label.  (See the description of 
    FtSize in the ArMap header file.)
 -- Added the ability to save the current map rotation as the default 
    to be used for map display (in Mapper3 and in MobileEyes).
    To save the rotation, choose Main Menu, Map, Rotate, Save as Default.


Mapper3 1.3.11
November 10, 2006
--------------------

Added additional parameters to control the creation of maps from
scan (.2d) files.  These are accessed from Scan Tools, Settings and
are contained in the Scan tab.  



Mapper3 1.3.10
October 20, 2006
--------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Modified the behavior of the Draw tool buttons that have popup
    menus.  When a popup menu item is selected, the associated Draw
    tool button is automatically turned on.
 -- Fixed an error in the Edit map item window that caused coordinate
    values of 0 to not be displayed under certain circumstances.


Mapper3 1.3.9
September 25, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:
 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when closing the map window before the
    map had finished loading.
 -- Fixed an error in the saving of rotated maps to an image file.  
 -- Changed the toolbar draw labels for the optional custom map items.  
    "Sector" is now "Advanced Areas" and "Boundary" is "Advanced Lines".
 -- Improved the logging of data when a crash occurs on Windows.  A 
    "mini-dump" file (named Mapper3ErrorDump_<Version>.dmp) is
    now created after a crash in the Mapper3 directory.  By 
    default, this dump file only contains stack trace information. 
    For problematic crashes that require more information, start 
    Mapper3 with the -debugDumpData option.

Mapper3 1.3.8
September 5, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes:
 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when undoing and redoing the rotation
    of map inserts.
 -- Fixed a crash that occurred when closing Mapper3 while a 
    map insert is in progress.
 -- Corrected a problem setting the rotation of a rectangle to 0 or 180 
    in the edit dialog.
 -- Corrected the "on" state of the Draw tools when switching between 
    multiple open maps.
 -- Fixed an intermittent crash that occurred when closing Mapper3.


Mapper3 1.3.7
August 15, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Removed calls that may have caused the GUI to be updated outside
    of the main thread when a robot connects to the central server.
 -- Improved the display of overlapping sectors and forbidden areas.
    The outline of all sectors and forbidden areas is now always 
    drawn on top.
 -- Modified the Measure line so that it doesn't call the map update
    as frequently (in an attempt to fix an intermittent crash).
 -- Changed the logic when the main window closes so that it also 
    proceeds if the active edit window is in the process of closing.  


Mapper3 1.3.6
July 19, 2006
-------------------

Corrected the kernel memory issue on Windows when using large maps
and removed the temporary workaround (in version 1.3.5).  


Mapper3 1.3.5
July 19, 2006
-------------------

Added a temporary workaround to a kernel memory issue on Windows when
using large maps.  A registry key can be set to turn off the creation 
of the map data lines.


Mapper3 1.3.4
July 12, 2006
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Increased the timeout when connecting to robots through a central
    server in order to reduce the likelihood that their initialization
    will be postponed.



Mapper3 1.3.3
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Fixed errors that occurred when the user indicates that the robot 
    configuration should be modified to use the current map.  In 
    particular, if an instance of MobileEyes changes the configuration 
    after Mapper3 has been started, then Mapper3 now 
    correctly updates the configuration data.



Mapper3 1.3.1
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- Reinserted the data Line draw tool, but it is now hidden by default.
    Use the Toolbars, Customize... option to access it.
 -- Mapper3 no longer disconnects from robots that don't support the 
    desired functionality (such as file transfers). 
    The connection is maintained so that the user can access the features
    that are supported.  
 -- When File, Save on Robot... fails, the user is now notified of the 
    error.
 -- Corrected problems with erasing data lines.  The lines now retain 
    their initial angle, instead of drifting slightly.  In addition, 
    the undo feature re-inserts only the original line, instead of all
    of the interim ones.
 -- Fixed the changed-indicator in the window title when all changes are
    undone.
 -- Removed temp files from the file history in the File menu.
 -- Fixed problems that occurred when the user cancels a File, Save on
    Robot... request in progress.  The request is now cancelled on the 
    server (i.e. the file is not written) and the local file returns to 
    its original state.     
 -- Fixed a bug that caused maps opened on a robot to be displayed with 
    a yellow background when the robot is not in safe drive mode.



Mapper3 1.3.0
-------------------

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:

 -- After processing a scan, if the map cannot be successfully saved, 
    then the user will now be warned when the Finish button is clicked.  
    (Previously, the scan would simply close and all work would be lost.)
 -- Modified the unhandled exception filter to prevent it from 
    being called recursively if another exception occurs during 
    execution of the filter.  This will hopefully preserve as much 
    information as possible about the initial exception in the error 
    report.
 -- Corrected the Boundary draw tool so that it is always initialized 
    with a valid subtype that can be selected in the drop down menu.
 -- Fixed an error in the Insert Map... feature that caused the entire
    insert to be selectable (and moveable) when the region was cancelled 
    by dragging the mouse outside of the map window.
 -- Fixed the Robot Servers combo box so that robots are displayed in 
    order of last use.
 -- Fixed the File menu so that the file name separators are always 
    correct for the platform, and duplicate file names do not appear.
 -- Fixed problems that occurred when a map was started to be saved on 
    a robot, but the file transfer was cancelled by the user.  The map now
    retains the correct modified state.
 -- Fixed the Edit Map Item window so that it closes when the OK or Cancel 
    button is clicked.  Previously, under certain circumstances, multiple 
    clicks were required to close the window.
 -- Fixed a processing error that occurred when the user cancelled a 
    file download or upload.  On certain occasions, Mapper3 would 
    enter a tight execution loop, possibly blocking the cancellation from
    completing.
 -- Fixed an error that prevented the Home (point or area) name from being 
    saved.


Mapper3 1.2.13

-------------------------

Changes to the readme and license text.


Mapper3 1.2.12

-------------------------

Corrected the location of icons in the installer.


Mapper3 1.2.11
February 24, 2006
-------------------------

Improved support for the new reflector items in the map.  The reflectors 
will be inserted along with the map points and lines into a containing map. 
The containing map's MapInfo lines will be updated to include reflectors, 
if necessary.  (This feature requires that the Reflector MapInfo line 
has the parameter isData=1.)  In addition, the display of reflectors may 
now be controlled via the Map, Data main menu item.

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:
 -- Fixed bug that prevented the map view preferences from being saved
    correctly in the file history.
 -- Fixed bug when the Line Draw Tool is on and the Map, Data, Points 
    item is subsequently selected.


Mapper3 1.2.10
February 7, 2006
-------------------------

Incorporated the latest ScanStudio changes that allow reflectors to be
added to the map data. 

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:
 -- Fixed a map insert bug that prevented the insert regions from being 
    drawn (introduced in 1.2.8).  Also cleared the map selection
    after the insertion completes in order to eliminate the stray
    rotate handle.
 -- Added the application name and version number to the debug error 
    report.
 -- Changed the name of the registry key in which user preferences 
    are saved to MobileRobots. (Previous preferences are automatically
    copied to the new key.)


Mapper3 1.2.8
December 22, 2005
-------------------------

Added a global exception handler for the Windows platform in order
to improve debugging capabilities.

Miscellaneous bug fixes and user interface enhancements:
 -- Disable the Line Draw tool button when inserting a map.
 -- Turn off the Select tool button when another map mode (such as 
    picking goals or inserting a map) is active.
 -- Fixed bug when saving the map as an image, and the image was too 
    big to be allocated.  The user is now notified of the situation and 
    advised of possible solutions.


Mapper3 1.2.6
August 24, 2005
-------------------------

-- Forbidden areas and other rectangular areas can now be rotated.
   WARNING: Old versions of ARNL (1.3 and earlier) will not be able to 
   interpret the rotation; to make a map compatible with old versions,
   make sure the forbidden areas have a rotation of 0 (see the status bar
   during rotation).
-- Lines may be erased with the eraser
-- More information is displayed in the status bar while modifying map objects
-- Improved editing of remote maps on robots
-- Has been tested on Windows XP
